									<h2>Action</h2>
								</header>
								<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film" style="color:blue">Action film</a> is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events 
								that typically include violence, extended fighting, physical feats and frantic chases. Action films tend to 
								feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, 
								a villain or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero (though a small number of films in this 
								genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead). Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to 
								create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past.
								However, reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed, as films that use computer 
								animations to create unrealistic, highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism. While action has long 
								been a recurring component in films, the "action film" genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase 
								of stunts and special effects.
								Common action scenes in films are generally, but not limited to, explosions, car chases, fistfights and shootouts.</p>
								<p>This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction.

Screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies Action Film as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters’ taxonomy, claiming that all feature 
length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres.  
The other ten super-genres are Crime, Fantasy, Horror, Romance, Science Fiction, Slice of Life, Sports, Thriller, War and Western. </p>
